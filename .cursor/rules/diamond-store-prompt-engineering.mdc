### Negative Prompts (What to Avoid)
Always mentally include these exclusions:
- No busy patterns or cluttered compositions
- No overly saturated colors
- No cartoon or illustration styles
- No product placement or jewelry items
- No harsh lighting or dramatic shadows
- No text or typography elements

### Quality Enhancers
Add these for premium results:
- "professional commercial photography"
- "high-end retail aesthetic"
- "luxury brand quality"
- "sophisticated composition"
- "premium visual design"

## Consistency Techniques

### Seed Usage
For related visuals, use the same seed:
```typescript
const baseParams = {
  seed: 12345, // Use same seed for visual consistency
  guidance_scale: 5,
  num_inference_steps: 28
};
```

### Color Palette Enforcement
Always specify exact color relationships:
```
primary color: pure white (#FFFFFF),
secondary color: soft gray (#F5F5F5),
accent color: rose gold (#E8B4A0),
avoid: bright colors, neon tones, oversaturation
```

### Style Anchoring
Reference established luxury brands indirectly:
```
"in the style of high-end jewelry boutique",
"luxury retail environment aesthetic",
"premium brand visual language"
```

## Testing and Iteration

### A/B Testing Prompts
Create variations to find optimal results:
```
Version A: "soft geometric patterns"
Version B: "subtle flowing curves"  
Version C: "minimal abstract shapes"
```

### Progressive Refinement
1. Start with basic prompt
2. Test and evaluate result
3. Add specific refinements
4. Re-test with adjustments
5. Document successful patterns

### Quality Metrics
Evaluate generated visuals on:
- Brand alignment (luxury, modern, trustworthy)
- Technical quality (resolution, lighting, composition)
- Usability (text overlay space, responsive design compatibility)
- Emotional impact (sophisticated, aspirational, accessible)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-specification**: Too many details can confuse the model
2. **Conflicting styles**: Mixing minimalistic with ornate elements
3. **Color overload**: Using too many accent colors
4. **Context confusion**: Mixing product and brand visual requests
5. **Technical misalignment**: Wrong aspect ratios for intended use

## Prompt Versioning
Keep track of successful prompts:
```json
{
  "hero_v1": "Base hero prompt...",
  "hero_v2": "Refined hero with better lighting...",
  "hero_v3": "Final optimized hero prompt..."
}
```
