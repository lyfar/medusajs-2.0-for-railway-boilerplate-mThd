# Backend Architecture

This section describes the proposed backend system, built for scalability and reliability.

## Proposed Stack

- **Platform**: A modern e-commerce platform (e.g., MedusaJS 2.x) hosted on a scalable cloud provider like Railway.
- **Core Modules**: The system will include modules for robust inventory management, file storage (e.g., MinIO for images/certificates), and email notifications.

## Product Data Model

- **Product Types**: The catalog will be structured to support both "White Lab Diamonds" and "Fancy Color Lab Diamonds".
- **Key Attributes**: Essential diamond characteristics (shape, carat, color, clarity, cut, lab type, certificate) will be stored as primary product data.
- **Inventory Logic**: Each unique diamond stone will be managed as a single inventory item to prevent overselling, even if it's presented with different settings or metals.

## Product Settings & Bundles

- **Bundled Products**: Instead of generating numerous variants for a single stone, the backend will use Medusa's bundled product feature. A new **Product Settings** menu in the admin dashboard lets staff define bundles that combine a stone with ring, necklace or other settings.
- **Per-Product Variations**: Each setting has its own relevant options (e.g., rings expose size and metal type; necklaces may expose chain length or style).
- **Scripts & Tooling**: Existing seeding scripts in the backend have been executed to populate sample data and will be extended to handle the new bundle schema.
