title: Lab Grown Diamonds – Proposal
---

# Proposal

**Total investment (one‑off build)**: 250,000 HKD

The kickoff budget covers design, development and launch. After go‑live, a recurring maintenance retainer ensures the site and supporting services stay healthy.

This proposal outlines the plan to launch a premium lab‑grown diamond storefront and supporting operations. It focuses on outcomes, scope and timelines without technical implementation details. Instead of generating numerous variants for each stone, the solution will leverage **Medusa.js bundled products** with a dedicated **Product Settings** menu to configure rings, necklaces and other styles.

## Deliverables (high‑level)

- [Ecommerce website](./ecommerce)
- [Backend architecture](./backend) (MedusaJS + inventory + imports)
- [Catalog and bundling strategy](./catalog) (white + fancy product types, thousands of SKUs)
- [Operations & management](./operations) (imports, ops, training docs)
- [SEO and content](./seo) (site structure, blog, AI‑assisted long‑form)
- [Branding](./branding) (basic consultancy to start)
- [Social media](./social) (content creation + management)
- [AI automations](./automations) (support bot, order updates)
- [Email marketing](./email) (flows + campaigns)
