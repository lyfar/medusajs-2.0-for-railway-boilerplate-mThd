title: Lab Grown Diamonds – Proposal
---

# Proposal

**Total investment (one‑off build)**: 235,000 HKD

The kickoff budget covers design, development and launch. After go‑live, a recurring maintenance retainer ensures the site and supporting services stay healthy.

This proposal outlines a plan to launch a premium lab‑grown diamond storefront and supporting operations, focusing on outcomes, scope and timelines. The solution leverages **Medusa.js bundled products** with a dedicated **Product Settings** menu to configure rings, necklaces and other styles.

## Proof of Concept

Following research and prototyping, we have built a working prototype that demonstrates the core storefront and admin workflow. This proof of concept shows our capability, commitment and the strong potential of the project, offering reassurance that we can deliver the full solution.

### Prototype Access

| Area | URL | Credentials |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Backend (Admin) | https://backend-store.dev.vodka/app | admin@yourmail.com / bnmugz7hs4gsk65l0566eos2s4kxmeho |
| Storefront | https://store.dev.vodka/ | Public |

### Prototype Scope & Findings

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Backend customization basics | Completed | Validated admin extensions and custom fields wiring |
| Stone metadata model | Completed | Tested metadata for two stone categories: White and Fancy; flexible attributes for search and filters |
| Setting bundles (stone + setting) | Not included in prototype | Planned validation next; to confirm UX and inventory constraints before implementation |

### Performance & Tech Highlights

- Built on modern tooling (MedusaJS backend, Railway infra, Meilisearch for fast faceting, optimized Next.js storefront)
- Focus on doing the fundamentals right: clean data model, efficient search, image optimization, and caching
- The result is a very fast browsing experience with snappy filtering and sub‑second navigations when deployed correctly
